3. **macOS setup:** You can follow [this instruction](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos).
   
   **Windows setup:** You can follow [this instruction](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows).

> **Note**: The "flutter doctor" command may encounter issues, and it's not necessary for every item to have a green checkmark. In the following image, the "flutter doctor" doesn't show all green checkmarks, but code can still run successfully. So, if you can't pass all the checks, you can still try running the project:

  If you successfully setup your environment, it will be displayed in Settings > Language & Frameworks > Flutter like this:

4. Run our app
    - Open Android Studio.
    - Go to "File" > "Open" and navigate to our project's directory. Select the project folder and click "Open."
    - Wait for Android Studio to load your project.
  
   Once the project is open:
    - In the left sidebar, navigate to the project's directory structure and find the main Dart file (named "main.dart") that represents our Flutter app's entry point.
    - Right-click on this file and select "Run" (make sure an emulator is running).
    - Android Studio will build and run your Flutter app on the emulator.
      
   You should see the app's interface on the emulator once the build process is complete.
