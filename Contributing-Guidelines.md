## How to Contribute

You can contribute to the doc repo or code repo in various ways. You could do so by reporting a bug, requesting a new feature, improving the docs, or writing code to solve current issues. Whenever you feel like to start, you will need to create an issue first.

## **For external contributors** - What you should always include while creating a new issue
- Label(s)
- Detailed issue description

## **For Joyful team members** - What you should always include while creating a new issue
- Label(s)
- Detailed issue description
- The assignee
- Milestones
- Corresponding project board
- Issue status - is it in progress?

## Requesting new features
A good issue to request new features should follow the given template and include the following elements:
- Explain why you need this new feature
- Tell us what you think
- Tell us what you expect
- Provide whatever information (steps to create, sketched prototypes, screenshots...) that makes your and our lives easier

## Reporting bugs
A good issue to report bugs should follow the given template and include the following elements:
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots
- The potential causes/solutions
- Being active - it would always be a plessure to have you testing our solutions before we merge the code

## Things to note
Here's what you should pay attention to:
- Do not abuse
- Though your issue might not be listed at the highest priority always, you are very welcomed to try to resolve it by yourself
- Be concise and precise about what you expect - you should not instill a whole bunch of "what-you-thinks"
- Do not recursively create issues. One issue plus comments are normally sufficient.
