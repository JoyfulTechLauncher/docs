# Doc-for-New-Developers

## Before you start
This is a list of what you should be able to do before you start:
1. know how to effectively use one of the following programming languages (Go, Java, C++, C#, Python, Kotlin, JavaScript)
2. know how to use the funtionalities GitHub / GitLab provides (Issue, PR, branch, tag....)
3. have previously worked in a team setting, know how to effectively communicate with teammates
4. be responsible for the tasks you are assigned with 
5. have basic knowledge about network programming (e.g., layers, HTTP requests)

## Getting started
The codebase is maintained by groups of students, and has existed for 2 years. 
- If you are an experienced developer, it's unavoidable that you will see lots of code that are not of high quality. You might feel like refactoring those, to either make them easiser to read or optimize them for a better quality.
- If you are a new developer, you might feel overwhelmed by the amount of code. Do not worry, many group members feel the same.

There are some suggestions provided to make your life easier:
1. Do not easily go into asking other members for help. Many members are not as experienced in coding as you think. Search for the answer by yourself first.
2. You should jump from methods to methods, starting with the main method to know how the code works as a whole. Use `CTRL + LEFT CLICK` while hovering over the method names to do so.
3. Create temporary branches, and write testing code to print out the logs while the app is running.
